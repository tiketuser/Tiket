# Concert vs Ticket Display - Complete Guide

## Current Issue

The Gallery is showing **ticket images** (like the screenshot with "Omer Adam" ticket) instead of **concert posters**.

## Why This Happens

Your database currently has:

- **No concerts** in the `concerts` collection
- **Only tickets** in the `tickets` collection

The Gallery component is now properly coded to fetch concerts, but if there are no concerts in the database, nothing will display (or it falls back to old ticket data).

## Solution: Create Concerts

You have **3 options** to populate concerts:

---

## Option 1: Run the Migration (Recommended if you have existing tickets)

This will convert your existing tickets into concerts automatically.

### Steps:

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/migrate
2. Click **"Run Migration"** button
3. Wait for completion
4. Check results

### What it does:

- Groups existing tickets by artist + date + venue
- Creates concert documents in `concerts` collection
- Generates additional random tickets per concert
- Backs up old data to `tickets_backup`

---

## Option 2: Create Concerts Manually (Recommended for new concerts)

Use the Admin panel to create concerts one by one.

### Steps:

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/Admin
2. Fill in the form:
   - Artist name (e.g., "עומר אדם")
   - Concert title (e.g., "הופעה מיוחדת 2025")
   - Date (format: dd/mm/yyyy)
   - Time (format: HH:MM)
   - Venue (e.g., "פארק הירקון")
   - Upload concert poster image
3. Click **"צור אירוע חדש"**
4. Concert appears in the gallery

### What you get:

- Clean, professional concert data
- Proper concert poster images
- Full control over each concert

---

## Option 3: Check Database Status First

Before doing anything, check what's in your database.

### Steps:

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/diagnostic
2. View your current data:
   - How many concerts exist
   - How many tickets exist
   - Which concerts are active
   - Sample ticket data

### This helps you decide:

- If you need to run migration (have tickets, no concerts)
- If you need to create concerts (have nothing)
- If everything is already set up

---

## How It Should Work

### Gallery (Homepage)

```
Shows: CONCERTS
- Concert poster image (not ticket scan)
- Artist name
- Date & time
- Venue
- Available tickets count
- Price range (from min to max)
```

### EventPage

```
Shows: CONCERT DETAILS + TICKETS
- Concert information
- List of available tickets (using SingleCard)
- Each ticket shows:
  - Section, row, seat
  - Individual price
  - Seller info
```

---

## Visual Difference

### Wrong (What you see now):

```
[Ticket Scan Image]
Omer Adam
20:15 | 06/08/2026
האצטדיון הלאומי רמת-גן
3 כרטיסים זמינים
```

_(Shows a scanned ticket document)_

### Correct (What you should see):

```
[Concert Poster Image]
עומר אדם
25/12/2025 | 20:00
פארק הירקון, תל אביב
15 כרטיסים זמינים
₪150 - ₪300
```

_(Shows a professional concert poster)_

---

## Technical Flow

### Current Architecture:

```
concerts/
   concert1 (artist: "עומר אדם", imageData: poster, date: "25/12/2025")
   concert2 (artist: "שלומי שבת", imageData: poster, date: "30/12/2025")

tickets/
   ticket1 (concertId: concert1, section: "A", price: 150)
   ticket2 (concertId: concert1, section: "B", price: 200)
   ticket3 (concertId: concert1, section: "VIP", price: 300)
   ticket4 (concertId: concert2, section: "A", price: 180)
```

### Gallery Component:

1. Fetches all concerts from `concerts` collection
2. For each concert, counts available tickets
3. Calculates price range from tickets
4. Displays concert card with:
   - Concert poster (`concert.imageData`)
   - Artist name (`concert.artist`)
   - Ticket count (filtered by `concertId`)
   - Price range (min-max from tickets)

### EventPage Component:

1. Fetches concert by ID or title
2. Fetches all tickets for that concert
3. Displays concert header
4. Lists individual tickets using SingleCard

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### If you have existing ticket data:

1. **Check status**:

   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000/diagnostic
   ```

2. **Run migration**:

   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000/migrate
   Click: "Run Migration"
   ```

3. **Verify results**:
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000
   Gallery should now show concerts with posters
   ```

### If starting fresh:

1. **Create concerts**:

   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000/Admin
   Create 3-5 concerts with posters
   ```

2. **Upload tickets** (optional):

   ```
   Use "העלאת כרטיס" dialog
   Upload ticket images with OCR
   System links tickets to concerts automatically
   ```

3. **View gallery**:
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000
   Gallery shows concerts
   Click concert → See tickets
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### "Gallery is empty"

- **Cause**: No concerts in database
- **Fix**: Create concerts via /Admin or run /migrate

### "Still showing ticket scans"

- **Cause**: Old cached data or browser cache
- **Fix**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) or clear browser cache

### "No tickets showing on EventPage"

- **Cause**: Tickets not linked to concert
- **Fix**: Ensure tickets have correct `concertId` field

### "Migration fails"

- **Cause**: No tickets to migrate
- **Fix**: Create concerts manually via /Admin

## Quick Actions

| Action         | URL                   | Purpose                    |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Check database | `/diagnostic`         | See what data exists       |
| Run migration  | `/migrate`            | Convert tickets → concerts |
| Create concert | `/Admin`              | Add new concert manually   |
| View gallery   | `/`                   | See concerts homepage      |
| View event     | `/EventPage/[artist]` | See concert + tickets      |

---

## Expected Result

After following the steps above, your Gallery will display:

Concert posters (professional images)
Artist names
Date/time/venue
Ticket availability count
Price ranges
"Sold out" badges when applicable

And clicking a concert takes you to EventPage where you'll see individual tickets with the SingleCard component.

---

## Need Help?

1. Visit `/diagnostic` to see current database state
2. Check console for any error messages
3. Verify Firebase connection in browser DevTools
4. Check that concerts have `imageData` field with base64 images

---

## Final Notes

The Gallery component is **correctly implemented** to show concerts. You just need to populate the `concerts` collection in Firestore. Once you do that (via migration or manual creation), the gallery will automatically display concert posters instead of ticket scans.
